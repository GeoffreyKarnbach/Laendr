# L채ndr

L채ndr: Your go-to platform for easily finding and booking the best party locations.

## Concept

L채ndr, your party location finder. No more need to search for hours to find a location suitable for your wedding or graduation party, we got you covered. With our custom reputation system, you know for sure, that your lender or renter will be trustworthy!

## Workflow

Two types of users can interact with lender, performing different tasks with different intents: <u>Lenders</u>, who offer they location, and <u>Renters</u> who search for a suitable location.

Lenders are able to lend their location for a given time period by:
- Create a new location (with name, address, size, position on a map, images)!
- Create timeslots for the given location, either for several consecutive hours or up to several days, it's up to you!
- Wait for your first renter requests

Renters are able to request a location for rent:
- Take a look at the start page with all available locations
- Filter the available locations to find your perfect match
- Initiate a request with the lender

Once a rent request is confirmed, a transaction is created and after the transaction time window is closed (after the planed rent date), the renter and lender are requested to rate their transaction partner.

## Technical Implementation

L채ndr has been implemented as a classical three-layer architecture, with a frontend layer (using Angular, Typescript and Bootstrap), a backend layer (using Java, SpringBoot and JPA) and a database layer (using H2).

## Features

### Gamification

The users are requested to rate other transaction partners. If they do, their rating completition score gets increased and is shown on their start page.
